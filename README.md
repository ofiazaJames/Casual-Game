FOOD CATCHER (Python Game)
	Generally, it is inspired to falling object games that a player needs to catch that thing, more of a arcade game. 
	We do not have a chance to tackle other libraries, so we decided to explore ourselves in python. Though the expectation was high, we were satisfied on the output. Yet, we planned to develop it according on what our prof suggested, like adding levels and adventure
	
It is a finished game, but we have encountered errors when we opened it, dated 5-31-2022. About 1 and a half years after it was opened again. Nevertheless, we cherish the experience of having a long long coding :)
